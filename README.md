# A testing repo for Erzorz

This repository exists simply to practice creating a [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository.  If you've stumbled onto it by accident, you might want to move along.  There is nothing much to see here.

[@fattire](https://twitter.com/fat__tire) is adding a few commits, which I'm going to learn to merge into my repo.

There ya go!
